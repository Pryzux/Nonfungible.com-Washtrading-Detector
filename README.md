## Purpose

This experimental program was created to try and provide insight using graph theory to identify wastrading of NFT assets. 

## Description

The program finds all the instances where an asset would be traded from one wallet to another/multiple wallet(s) and then transferred back to the original wallet. The final result is a .csv containing a 
list of all transactions that have been linked together in the cycling of an asset. AKA a history of sales that the asset went through until it eventually was resold/transferred back to the original wallet.

## Tech Stack

This program uses MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), which is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.
